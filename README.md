# EVA

an Energy Visualisation App for smart meter data from DCC network.

# Purpose of this web app

Having used many different apps for checking energy use, there are bits that nag me and bits that i love. So instead of having few apps that does the same thing in a round about way. I device i am goin to build a better version to give me the data the way i want. Might be a challenge, but challenge acepted.

This will also serve as a learning and development project to further my knowledge.

## Main features

- Simple clean functional interface.
- At a glance see comparison vs previous day (adjacent and same day the previous week) and previous (percent up or down).
- Compare day to day, week to week, or month to month.
- Always show current day by default, with option to add the previous day until a month is reached.
- Quickly switch to day, week or month view
- Option to show both Gas and Electric on same graph (stacked or line)
    - Stacked gives an idea of total energy usage
    - line gives a comparison of usage between gas and electric
